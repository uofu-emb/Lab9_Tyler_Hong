Hong Chen, and Tyler Evans. 
5785 is the final FSM 
the md file that is not the readme is the FSM state table. 
page 1 is the final draft FSM 
page 2 is Tyler's 1st FSM
page 3 is Hongs 1st FSM 

Our New FSM is quite similar to some of our pervious FSM's 
However, there are some diffrences. I included the timing as an event 
but hong did not. Hong's FSM was able to simplify things greatly 
so we used this in the final FSM.
